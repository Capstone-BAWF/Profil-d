Donald J. Trump,2016-05-29 23:02:01,If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!
Donald J. Trump,2016-05-29 22:58:27,The Republican Party has to be smart &amp; strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
Donald J. Trump,2016-05-29 22:53:16,Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!

Donald J. Trump,2016-05-28 20:28:40,The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp; get much better results! What we need as Prez!
Donald J. Trump,2016-05-28 20:28:22,The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- &amp; I'm beating her.
