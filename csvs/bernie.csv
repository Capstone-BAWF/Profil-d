Bernie Sanders,2016-06-15 00:43:06,We know that one hateful person committed a heinous crime not an entire people. To blame an entire religion is nothing less than bigotry.

Bernie Sanders,2016-06-14 23:33:06,The idea that weapons designed to do one thing – kill people by the dozens – should be sold and distributed in our country is absurd.

Bernie Sanders,2016-06-09 13:06:05,The American people know that it is not acceptable that the top tenth of 1 percent owns as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-09 01:22:05,Our mission is more than just defeating Trump. It is transforming our country. People want something to vote for rather than just against.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-08 23:12:06,The American people will never support a candidate whose major theme is bigotry. We will not allow Donald Trump to become president.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-08 21:02:05,We will not allow right-wing Republicans to control our government. That is especially true with Donald Trump as the Republican candidate.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-08 19:56:01,Young people understand that they are the future of America and they intend to help shape that future.
