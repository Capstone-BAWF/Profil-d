Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286659,Almost every country in the world has at least 10 days of paid vacation per year, except the United States.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286663,It is a national disgrace that billionaires are able to heavily influence the political process by making huge contributions.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286668,Millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages. They are overworked, underpaid and under enormous stress.

Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286797,The idea that in the State of New York 3 million people could not participate in helping select the Democratic nominee is incomprehensible.

Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286811,We know that one hateful person committed a heinous crime, not an entire people. To blame an entire religion is nothing less than bigotry.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286815,These types of weapons, without a doubt, should be banned.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286820,The idea that weapons designed to do one thing – kill people by the dozens – should be sold and distributed in our country is absurd.

Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286934,Some of us believe that what God teaches is to not turn our backs on our brothers and our sisters, that essentially we are in this together.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286938,Our economy works for Wall Street because it’s rigged by Wall Street. As long as Washington's bought, our economy won't work for the people.

Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286947,We must lead the world in working with China, Russia, India and the international community to break our energy dependence on fossil fuel.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286952,Millions of lives are being wrecked, families are being torn apart and we are spending huge sums of taxpayer money by locking people up.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286956,We must not succumb to bigotry. We must do what we do best as Americans – fight racism, fight xenophobia and fight fear.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286961,A job must lift workers out of poverty, not keep them in it. The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.286965,We cannot continue to send our jobs to China and other low-wage countries when millions of Americans need work.

Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.287013,When millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, we won't allow 57 percent of all new income to go to the top 1 percent.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.287017,I'm horrified by yesterday's terrorist attack in Tel Aviv. My thoughts are with the victims' families and all of those harmed.

Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.287026,Our mission is more than just defeating Trump. It is transforming our country. People want something to vote for rather than just against.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.287031,The American people will never support a candidate whose major theme is bigotry. We will not allow Donald Trump to become president.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.287036,We will not allow right-wing Republicans to control our government. That is especially true with Donald Trump as the Republican candidate.
Bernie Sanders,2016-06-30 14:35:33.287040,Young people understand that they are the future of America, and they intend to help shape that future.
